## A quick note:

* This converter is my first C++ project on GitHub and on the internet for that matter.  
* I've used basic C++11 code and terminal interface to run the program, keeping simplicity in mind.
* Your feedback would be highly appreciated! Feel free to get in touch using the contact details on my GitHub profile.
